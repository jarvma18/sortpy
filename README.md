# sortpy

More information about this challenge here:
https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-sort/

Basically this code tries to implement same functionalities as sort tool. I use python here because I want to learn it more.

I presume that you have python already installed (install it if not).

```
// Basic lexiographic sort with the usage of other tools
python3 main.py words.txt | uniq | head -n5

// Run unit tests
python3 -m unittest test.py
```
